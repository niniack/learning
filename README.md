## Docendo discimus (Latin "by teaching, we learn")

The objective of this **slowly** growing repository is to act as a resource for interview preparation. 
The idea is to break down concepts and problems in good detail, avoiding quick & dirty summaries. 

I will make it a mission to provide appropriate credit to sources I used while constructing the explantaion. Hence, explanations will often cite several different sources that I thought did a great job. If the link is dead, refer to a webarchive capable of providing the link at an earlier date. 

If you have found this because I cited you but you do not want your link/information here, then please contact me and I will remove it. 

Oh, and see the wiki!
