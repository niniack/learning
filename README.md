## Docendo discimus (Latin "by teaching, we learn")

The objective of this slowly growing repository will be to act as a resource for learning. 
The idea will be to break down concepts and explain them in detail (so not really summaries).

Explanations will often cite several different sources that did a great job. Each source will surely be given approprate credit by providing a link to it. If the link is dead, refer to a webarchive capable of providing the link at an earlier date. 

If you have found this because I cited you, but you do not want your information here, then please contact me and I will remove it.
